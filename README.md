# Bower Example

Bower is a client-side package manager for managing dependencies for the web.

### Usage

The usage is in fact very similar to NPM usage.

In the CLI:

```
bower install <package name>
```

to save locally as a dev dependency:

```
bower install <package name> --save
```

Just make sure to ignore the bower_components directory during git commit.
